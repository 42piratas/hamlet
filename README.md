## About  

Hamlet is a chatbot built with [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org).  

The idea here is to have a chatbot that answers to all interactions with adequate quotes from Shakespeare's plays. The catchy part being, as you might imagine, translating from/to old English in order to make the dialogues work - which Hamlet does using not only a bank of synonyms, but also sentiment analysis.    

## Status   
Due to tough issues with performance, I'm currently rewritting Hamlet's entire structure. Also, I'm taking the _opportunity_ to build a good base of tests from ground zero.
