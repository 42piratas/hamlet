## About  

_Hamlet_ is a chatbot built with [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org).  

The idea here is to have a chatbot answering - with some level of "intelligence" - to all interactions with quotes from Shakespeare's plays. The catchy part being, as you might imagine, "translating" from/to old English in order to make the dialogues work.
